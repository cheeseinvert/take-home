# How to run Adam's Frontend Takehome submission

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Please launch the react development server on your local machine as described below: 

1. Clone the repo by typing "git clone https://github.com/cheeseinvert/take-home.git" 
2. Change working directory into the take-home workspace you just cloned: "cd take-home"
3. Install dependencies by typing: "yarn install"
4. Launch the react development sever by entering: "yarn start"
5. In the browser open URL: "http://localhost:3000"

As the page loads it will make the request to the Infinitus service and render a stacked accordion view of "capability categories".

6. Click on the categories one by one to verify the categorized capabilities and their enabled status.



### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
